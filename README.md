## Game Details
  📽️ [Project Demo](https://youtu.be/iY4CsemImsI)  
  🏆 Miauhem is the result of our Modern C++ course: a retro-inspired, FFA/Team Based, multiplayer, multi-lobby supporting game, where each player has to claw their way to victory!  
  🧶 Throw yarn, destroy boxes, disguised bombs, and outsmart your opponents, in order to be the last one standing!  
  💯 Each player can earn points and score, through which they can improve their fire rate and bullet speed!  
  💀 Beware of sudden death! Once either three minutes pass, or 2 players remain alive, the map starts closing in, and each survivor is reduced to one hitpoint!  

## Tech Features:
